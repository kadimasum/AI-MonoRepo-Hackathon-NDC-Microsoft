# AI Hackathon Repository  

Welcome to the official repository for the **AI Hackathon** under the theme **AI-Assisted Development and JavaScript Monorepos**.  
This repository will guide participants with resources, examples, and instructions to explore how artificial intelligence can boost productivity and collaboration in monorepo environments.

## JavaScript Monorepos Documentation  

### What is a Monorepo?  

A **monorepo** (short for *monolithic repository*) is a single Git repository that contains multiple projects. Instead of managing each project in its own repository, all related codebases live in one place.  

In JavaScript/TypeScript development, monorepos are often used to:  
- Share code between multiple apps and packages  
- Simplify dependency management  
- Improve collaboration across teams  
- Enable consistent tooling, CI/CD pipelines, and testing  

For example, a monorepo might include:  
- A frontend app (React, Vue, or Angular)  
- A backend service (Node.js/Express)  
- Shared UI components or utilities  
- Configuration and scripts for CI/CD  

---

### Benefits of Monorepos  

- **Code Sharing** → Reuse components across multiple projects.  
- **Single Source of Truth** → All code lives in one repo.  
- **Atomic Changes** → Update multiple packages in one commit/PR.  
- **Centralized CI/CD** → One pipeline for testing, building, and deployment.  
- **Scalability** → Supports large codebases and teams.  

---

### Tools for JavaScript Monorepos  

Several tools make working with JavaScript monorepos easier:  

- [**Turborepo**](https://turbo.build/repo) → High-performance build system for JavaScript & TypeScript monorepos.  
- [**Nx**](https://nx.dev/) → Extensible monorepo framework with generators, executors, and caching.  
- [**Lerna**](https://lerna.js.org/) → Popular tool for managing JavaScript projects with multiple packages.  
- [**pnpm Workspaces**](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) → Fast, disk-efficient package manager with workspace support.  
- [**Yarn Workspaces**](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) → Workspace support built into Yarn.

## AI-Assisted Development Documentation  

### What is AI-Assisted Development?  

**AI-Assisted Development** is the use of artificial intelligence tools to help developers write, debug, optimize, and maintain code.  
Instead of replacing developers, AI tools act as **co-pilots** — making suggestions, generating boilerplate code, refactoring, and even documenting code automatically.  

In hackathons, AI assistance helps teams move faster, learn new tools, and focus on solving problems instead of repetitive coding tasks.  

---

### Benefits of AI-Assisted Development  

- **Faster Prototyping** → Quickly generate code and try new ideas.  
- **Reduced Boilerplate** → Automate repetitive coding tasks.  
- **Error Detection** → AI can suggest fixes and optimizations.  
- **Learning Tool** → Great for exploring new frameworks or languages.  
- **Collaboration** → AI can serve as a shared assistant across teams.

### Getting Started with AI-Assisted Development  

#### Install VS Code & GitHub Copilot  

1. [Download and install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).  
2. Open VS Code and go to the **Extensions Marketplace**.  
3. Install the [GitHub Copilot extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot).  
4. Sign in with your GitHub account.  
5. Start coding — Copilot will suggest completions automatically.  

#### Example: Using Copilot in JavaScript  

```javascript
// Write a comment describing the function
// Copilot will suggest the implementation

// Function to calculate factorial of a number
function factorial(n) {
    if (n <= 1) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
